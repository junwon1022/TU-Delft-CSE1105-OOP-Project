# Git Assignment


#### Personal Data

Grade: Pass

Feedback: Full name and TUD email address was used.


#### .gitignore

Grade: Pass

Feedback: build/ and .gradle folders have not been commited and .gitignore is there. This is not mandatory but I personally recommend having the files in the repository directly instead of a subfolder, since currently your master branch has repo->folder->files, so it would be "nicer" to have repo->files since there is nothing else in the repo folder.


#### History

Grade: Pass

Feedback: There is a merge commit, which solves the conflict between the "uppercase" feature and "changed greeting".


#### Merge Requests

Grade: Pass

Feedback: The merge of the feature branches has been performed via Merge Requests


#### Clean-up

Grade: Fail

Feedback: The repository should not contain any branches apart from main/master.


#### Assignment Completion

Grade: Fail. One or more of the above criteria were failed. Please fix it until Friday evening of W4.
