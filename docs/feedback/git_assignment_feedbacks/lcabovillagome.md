# Git Assignment


#### Personal Data

Grade: Pass

Feedback: Full name and TUD email address was used.


#### .gitignore

Grade: Fail

Feedback: The repository contains meaninless files (.idea folder specifically and .DS_Store). This is not mandatory but I personally recommend having the demo files in the repository directly instead of a subfolder. Also note on the .DS_Store files, MacOS does that so I recommend adding them to the .gitignore so you don't have to delete them everytime.


#### History

Grade: Fail

Feedback: There is only one form/merge from main. There should be a different one for each feature. 


#### Merge Requests

Grade: Fail

Feedback: Only one MR has been merged. The merge of the feature branches needs have been performed via Merge Requests. There should be at least 4 MRs.


#### Clean-up

Grade: Pass

Feedback: The repository contains only one branch.


#### Assignment Completion

Grade: Fail. One or more of the above criteria were failed. Please fix it until Friday evening of W4.
