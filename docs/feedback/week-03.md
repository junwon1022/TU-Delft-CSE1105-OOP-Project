# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Dave
Minute taker: Marina

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and minute taker.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Agenda followed the template but it was missing individual points. E.g. announcements section was not filled in and other sections were missing more specific points. Try to make it more specific next time, what points are you going to discuss in that part of the meeting - don't only include the parts of the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Note: gave feedback on this last meeting.

Mark: Good

Feedback: Very good notes, at the end you could add a little summary of anythin important that was said and/or highlight important stuff on the document. It was nice how you had a question->answer style of notes.


#### Chair performance

*TA Instructions:*
Please consider the following dimensions in your assessment:

- Did the chair ensure that all topics of the agenda were covered?
- Were all topics covered for an appropriate amount of time?

Mark: Sufficient->Good

Feedback: Good decisive spirit but try not to be too aggressive when others speak - listen to what they have to say and then make your points. Most topics were covered and followed some part of the structure but missed the Announcements and the approval of the agenda, moved on to Questions on Spring boot before discussing the Backlog section. Make sure you follow the structure of the agenda more precisely to help have an organized meeting. Time management was good.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Good discussions in the meeting, again mostly 3 people were speaking but I did see increased initiative from the rest compared to last time so great! Good points were made and you listened to each other. It is good that you were mostly talking as well instead of me and good that you asked meaningful questions. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: It is a bit early to reflect on this. Progress is being made, hoping to see good things next week :)
