## Formative Assessment


#### 1) Self-organization - Good

» Was the team in charge? Did everybody speak? Was the tone respectful?

The team felt quite in charge. Although I did present the topics & go through them, you made sure to ask questions, come up with other topics and to generally share their thoughts/ideas. Really promising for a first meeting.

It did feel like not everyone spoke as much. I would encourage you as a group to try to make the amount of ideas that people share as equal as possible. Encourage each other to come out of your shells, so to speak.

The tone was respectful, nothing to comment.


#### 2) Suggested Topics - Good

» Have all the suggested topics been covered? Did they try to moderate the meeting? You can point to the teamwork lecture, there they will learn what is expected from them.

All topics were covered. The meeting was not necessarily moderated, but that was to be expected. You did as well as you could have with what you were given. I appreciated that I was stopped so you could ask questions. It felt like I was not talking to myself.

I would suggest that you go through the teamwork material, such that you know how to moderate the following meetings that you have with Danae :)
