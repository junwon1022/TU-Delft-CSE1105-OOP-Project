### Backlog


### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Make sure the naming is correct next time. Should be backlog.pdf not backlog_draft.pdf


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Well structured, includes a list of stakeholders, important terms of the domain and a (prioritized) list of user stories. Could but not necessary, include mockups that illustrate the application. Coloring the Administrator parts is not needed. User description could be improved. Good descriptions in terminology.


### Epics

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Backlog contains an epic for "minimal app". List of epics is complete and prioritization is consistent with the lectures. Epics have a good introduction that clarify the feature. Mockups could be optionally added. Really good job with this part, bravo!


### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback:
- You could have the format of the example backlog so there is no need to write "as a user" repeatedly (this is only a suggestion).
- The user stories follow the required format and have a clear focus on the user perspective.
- Try to minimize ambiguity 
    - "easy to navigate" what does this mean?
    - "share the same workspace" how?
- Try to minimize overlap
    - "The synchronization should be seamless" basically means "with minimal delay or lag".
- Keep a consistent name: either tasks or cards.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Good

Feedback: If the acceptance criteria is only one see if you can directly add it as a user story. Some user stories seem long, try to make them shorter and to the point without repeating information. Try and think of "what feature will I need to implement to satisfy this user story? what issue on gitlab can I make?", more direct and less general. User stories/acceptance criteria should be formulated in a measurable/observable way that allows to decide when a story is done/finished.
