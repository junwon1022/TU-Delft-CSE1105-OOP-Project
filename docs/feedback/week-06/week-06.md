# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Junwon
Minute taker: Luis

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was chair and minute taker


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: Agenda was added to the repository in time, follows the template and had good points. I was confused with the "Code Reviews. Receiving feedback" section which only had "(discuss)" in it. You should add _what_ you need to discuss. Also, the discussion of what progress was done in the past week makes sense (to me at least) to be after the "Check-in" section.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: Notes have been merged into the agenda file. There are certainly not enough notes considering it was a 45min meeting with a lot of content. I found it difficult separating notes from the agenda because they were almost identical. Total lines of notes was about 5. Write about what was decided during the meeting, any agreements you made, any highlighs, questions you had that were answered and any feedback I (the TA) gave you.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Insufficient<->Sufficient

Feedback: You started nicely, I noticed however when you directed the discussion to other people and they went a bit off topic or were talking extensively on this, just make sure that you are in "control" of the flow of the meeting and clearly "end" a topic discussion and move on to the next one. Take more initiative, it did not really feel like you were a chairperson today. Some topics were covered but agenda was not really followed.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Good discussion, mostly 1-2 people dominating the conversations but others also jumped in sometimes (would be nice to see more of that though). Few people were not giving ideas that much, try to have everyone participate. Constructive atmosphere overall, good decisions and planning, keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficien/Sufficient

Feedback: Nice demo, some stuff are working already, there is still room for improvement of course but you are on a good track!
