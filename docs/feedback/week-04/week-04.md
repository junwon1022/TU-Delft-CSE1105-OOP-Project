# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Aleksandra
Minute taker: Liviu

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and minute taker.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Excellent agenda! Very good points in it and good time allocation for each part. It follows the template and it was uploaded to the repository in time.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: Very good notes, I like how it is consistent with the agenda yet the notes are more dominant in the file. 
- Bullet points indicate good action points for each section (keep that) and they don't contain unnecessary information. 
- Good amount of notes in general, all seem pretty clear and contain concrete agreements. 
- No people naming in the notes yet, I would recommend during the meeting taking action and deciding what each person has to do for the week and documenting that decision in the notes so everyone knows what they need to do. 
- Amazing that you have the summary at the end!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Very good, it really felt like you were the chairperson and in charge. I like how you direct the discussion to each person. All topics were covered within the allocated time, but you went overtime in some topics which left you with less time at the end for the summary etc (I might be a little bit at fault in this since I talked in the beginning, but try to adjust to keep it within the timeframe). Also nice how you suggested what you could do/talk about and waited for approvals on that rather than doing immediately what you thing is right. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Nice suggestions from teammembers and others giving their opinions on those. Again, 2-3 people were not taking initiative. It would be nice if the next chairperson directs the discussion to the people not speaking so that they feel more comfortable with speaking (current chairperson did that a bit today which was good).
It was amazing to see you all encouraging and offering to help your teammate with something that he was having trouble with. Great that you discussed what you each felt on how fast the project is progressing and what you can do about it ("discuss more and communicate more so this stuff doesn't happen)". Good that you took ownership of the meeting, no need for me to talk a lot nor guide the meeting. Constructive atmosphere, something was being done at any point during the meeting.

- Tip: Use gitlab features (labels, assignees, reviewers, milestones, weights etc...)!

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: No ready product yet, but the team is making progress. The database is set up and everyone knows what they need to implement for the week (make sure to assign issues though). It seems that you are on track. Keep it up!
