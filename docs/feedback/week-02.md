# Week 2


## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Liviu
- **Notetaker**: Junwon

#### Meeting Organization

TA Instructions: Were there a chair and a minute taker?  

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and minute taker.


#### Agenda 

TA Instructions: Was it delivered in time? Did it follow the template?

Mark: Good

Feedback: Good, it followed the template nicely you could however make it a bit more detailed and personalised to the group e.g. add specific questions you had during the week etc.

#### Chair performance

TA Instructions: Did the chair ensure that all topics of the agenda were covered?

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Made sure topics were covered but lacked a bit initiative, the meeting was mostly taken charge of by 2-3 other members, so next time the chairperson should take a bit more initiative compared to the other group members.

#### Time management

TA Instructions: Was there time for all topics? Were all topics covered for an appropriate amount of time?

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: All topics were covered, however 5 minutes were allocated in the agenda for the backlog and it ended up lasting more than 20 minutes.

#### Minute taker performance

TA Instructions: Is there a good amount of notes? Do the notes contain the team agreements and the assigned people?

Mark: Good

Feedback: Very good notes, at the end you could add a little summary of anythin important that was said and/or highlight important stuff on the document. It was nice how you had a question->answer style of notes.

#### Relation

TA Instructions: Was everyone involved? Did everyone contribute to the discussion topics in an equal amount? Was everyone listened to? Were everybody's ideas taken into account?

Mark: Good

Feedback: Very good discussions. Considered the pros and cons when deciding on something, fast and concrete decisions. Great initiative from the girls, however only 3 poeple seemed to be talking during the meeting. Next time it would be good to see others take initiative as well. Friendly atmoshpere overall.

## Notes
  Some points I may or may not have made in the meeting that you can take note of:
  * Avoid adding any extra features to the backlog other than the ones mentioned in the lectures as they will not be graded.
  * Having just user stories is fine for the backlog, mockups might make it easier to plain the details so they will be appreciated.
